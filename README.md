# TTT2_SQL-Statistics-Tracker
Repository for my addon "TTT2 SQL Statistics Tracker"


To track statistics and show them in a scoreboard on your loading screen, you either need an external webserver or set up a webserver on your own machine. I recommend you to set up a XAMPP Apache webserver on your own machine, port cheap webserver with atleast 200MB MySQL Space or 

with mysql database and sql space larger than 50MB OR you set up XAMPP Apache on your machine, portforward correctly and maybe use something like DynDns.
